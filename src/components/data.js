It focuses on application of Machine Learning techniques in various interdisciplinary research areas includes Motion analysis, Bioinformatics and Computer Vision.
CISMR lab provides a unique facility for talented individuals coming from Ph.D., master as well as undergraduate levels. The collaborative spirit of these talented individuals is employed to design and evaluate novel mechanisms of Robotics, Motion Analysis for a wide range of application areas such as Rehabilitation , Healthcare, Sports, entertainment, and training.
CISMR is a group of researchers who study, analyze, and build different aspects of Pattern Recognition and Motion Analysis systems (e.g. Gait, Transport System). By understanding and measuring complex patterns, we try and build solutions for social good. Our work primarily derives from Data Science, Gait Analysis and Machine Learning.
